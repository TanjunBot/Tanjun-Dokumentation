# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy comprehensively describes how Tanjun ("the bot") collects, uses, stores, and protects your information. By using Tanjun, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. We are committed to handling your data with the greatest possible care.

## 1. What Information We Collect

Tanjun collects only the information essential for specific commands and functionalities. This includes:

- **User-Provided Information:** Data you provide directly through interactions with the bot, such as scheduled messages, giveaways, or tickets. This may include metadata such as timestamps and channel information.
- **Automatisch gesammelte Informationen:** Zur Gewährleistung bestimmter Funktionen, wie etwa der Nachrichtenanforderung bei Gewinnspielen, speichern wir lediglich, wie viele Nachrichten eine Nutzer-ID in bestimmten Kanälen gesendet hat. The content of the messages remains untouched.
- **Third-Party Data:** Some features utilize external services like the Twitch API. No personal data is shared. However, user IDs, usernames, and profile pictures may be transmitted to third parties.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The collected information may be used for the following purposes:

- Providing and improving the bot's functionality, including tailoring responses to individual user needs.
- Enhancing the user experience through automated processes that enable more personalized interactions.
- Diagnosing and resolving technical issues to ensure uninterrupted use of the bot.
- Analyzing usage trends to further develop features. Such analyses are always conducted on an anonymized basis to protect your privacy.
- Communicating with users about important changes, updates, or relevant notifications regarding the bot.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information. Data is only shared in the following scenarios:

- **To Comply with Legal Obligations:** When required by law, court order, or to protect our legal rights.
- **Service Providers:** With trusted third-party providers that support the operation of the bot, such as hosting services or data analysis providers. These partners are contractually obligated to handle your data securely and confidentially.
- **With Your Explicit Consent:** In rare cases, we may share data if you explicitly agree, for instance, for special collaborations or extended functionalities.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy policy or as required by law. Once data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized. We regularly review stored data to ensure it remains necessary and use automated processes to remove outdated information.

## 5. Security

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or destruction. These include encryption technologies, firewalls, and regular security audits. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We continuously work to improve our security standards.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access Your Data:** Request a copy of the information we hold about you.
- **Correction:** Request the update or correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Deletion:** Request the removal of your data, provided there are no legal or contractual obligations preventing this.
- **Restriction of Processing:** Request that we limit the use of your data under certain circumstances.

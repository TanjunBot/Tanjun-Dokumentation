<summary>Notes on how we specify commands</summary>

When we specify commands, they often contain elements that you need to replace with something. We specify these cases as follows:

<pre><code><strong>/command-name <Required argument> [Optional argument]
</strong></code></pre>

As in the example, the characters `<`, `>`, `[` and `]` indicate required and optional arguments, which you must enter yourself.
